Gala Groceries has approached to the company to help them with an issue related to their inventory management. The company specializes in the retail of food items and household essentials, which are highly perishable items. Overstocking can lead to waste and increased storage costs, while understocking can result in lost sales and dissatisfied customers. Therefore, it is important for the company to find a balance between having enough inventory to meet customer demand without incurring unnecessary costs.
